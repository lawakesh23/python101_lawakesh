1.Create a file and write down shebang of Bash and Perl.
Ans- 
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #!/bin/sh
    #!/bin/sh -
 
adding a dash to the end prevents someone passing a command to your script, but canâ€™t find any details on that.

 #!/usr/bin/perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#!/usr/bin/env perl

The first two specify the directory from which to run Perl. As a bonus, this form allows passing an option, e.g. -w (used to turn on warnings).
