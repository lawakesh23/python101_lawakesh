5. Open Interpreter and type __name__ . What was the output of it?

Ans- 
>>>__name__
'__main__'

 It will define a few special variables. __name__ is one such special variable. If the source file is executed as the main program, the interpreter sets the __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name.
